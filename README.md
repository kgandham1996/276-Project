# Project Name

## How is this problem solved currently (if at all)?

## How will this project make life better? Is it educational or just for entertainment?

[APP] is a party game, where the players are groups of friends or strangers that compete against one another in a fast-paced game of guessing the song title, artist, or missing lyrics that is associated with a short 10-15seconds music clip that plays. The aim of [APP] is to provide entertainment and a fun activity for groups of friends or strangers to play on weekends, game nights, trivia nights, bars, etc. which gives them an opportunity to socialize and create closer bonds amongst each other, and make new friends. While, [APP] is more focused on providing entertainment, it does indirectly help make life easier by relieving stress and creating friendships through the fun gameplay and socialization opportunities.

## Who is the target audience?

Our target audience for [APP] is aimed towards young adults who are interested in playing party type games with their own friend groups. As well as, adults who are looking to socialize and create new friendships.

## Does this project have many individual features, or one main feature (possibility with many subproblems)? These are the ‘epics’ of your project.

## What are some sample stories/scenarios? For example, as a regular user to your site, what types of things can I do? These are the ‘stories’ of your project.

Any user would be able to log in to their unique account and be given the option to either create a party,join a party, or start a solo game. If the user chose to create a party then others would be able to join the party using a password and they could play a multiplayer match. When playing, users will be given the option to pick their genre or era of music as well as the option of if they would like to play the standard text input version,  a multiple-choice version or potentially even a speech to text version. For example, if the user chose the text input version, they would be prompted to type the name of the song and artist after the sample snipper of the song has been done playing. If the user chose multiple choice version, there would be four choices to pick from and the user would need to select one. Each user would also have the option of viewing their personal leaderboards or global leader boards to check high scores and win/loss records.

## Is the amount of work required in this proposal enough for five group members?

Yes, we believe it to be enough work. We plan on implementing different modes of play, such as text input, multiple choice, and potentially speech recognition. Along with options of multiplayer or solo play. There will also be the task of implementing two API’s, one for displaying the lyrics and the other for getting the artist and song information. Lastly, we would need to deal with the creation of profiles and linking these them to leaderboards.
